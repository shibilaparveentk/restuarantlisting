               ANGULAR - Front end technology
                 
                 
                 
                    -Basic commands

             1. To create project- ng new project-name

             2.To run project- ng serve /ng serve --open

             3.To generate components- ng g c component-name

             4.To create service- ng g s service-name

             5.To create pipe- ng g p pipe-name



                    -Basic concepts

    1. Module- Import libraries - Root Module - AppModule

    2. generate html,css,ts - Root components -AppComponent

    3.  setup path for component - AppRoutingModule
      -syntax: {path: 'path name' , component:component-name} inside Routes array

    4. Selectors - replace it with corresponding component html page

    5.router-outlet selector is used to switch page
     accordinh to user request in root component html page

    6.Angular service- reusable code can be stored ,and  we can use it in all component accross the application 

    7.Dependency injection- share data btw dependent classes -and will do in constructor
      -syntax: access specifiers variable-name: dependent-class-name

      access-specifiers (public/private)

    8.Asynchronous function call - (rxjs libraries) Observable 
     - resolve state( subscribe method)
     - reject state (catch)

    9.Data binding - share data within a component
      diff types of data binding:

        9.1 one way binding- share only in one direction at a time

            9.1.1 component(ts) to view(html) file
              
               9.1.1.1 String interpolation- 
                       syntax:{{class-property-name}} in html

               9.1.1.2 Propety binding-
                       syntax:
                       [attribute]="class-property-name"

            9.1.2 view(html) to component(ts) file
           
               9.1.2.1 Event binding - (event-name)="function call"

               9.1.2.2 Event binding using $event- (event-name)="function call($event)"
          
        9.2 two way binding- share only in 2 direction at a time

             9.2.1 ngModel - Import FormsModule , [(ngModel)] = "property-name"


    10. Angular directives - to manipulate DOM
         
           10.1 Component Directive
           10.2 Structural Directive -based on condition or array length we can add or remove html elements from DOM.

              -10.2.1 *ngIf = "condition" inside an html 
              -10.2.2 *ngFore="let iterator of array-name"

          10.3 Attribute Directive - based on some value/ class property we can set style of html elements.

    11. Activated route-Provides access to information about a route associated with a component that is loaded in an outlet. 

    12.ngForm- to track the form values

    13.pipe - use pipes to transform strings,currency ammounts,dates and other data for display.

    14.Behavior subject- used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data
